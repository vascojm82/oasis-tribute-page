			<h2>BIO</h2>
			<p>Oasis were an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1991. Developed from an earlier group, the Rain, the band originally consisted of Liam Gallagher 
			(vocals, tambourine), Paul "Bonehead" Arthurs (guitar), Paul "Guigsy" McGuigan (bass guitar), and Tony McCarroll (drums). Upon returning to Manchester, Liam's older brother,
			Noel Gallagher (lead guitar, vocals) joined as a fifth member, which formed the band's core and settled line-up. During the course of their existence, they have undergone 
			various line-up changes.</p>

			<p>Oasis signed to independent record label Creation Records in 1993 and released their record-setting debut album Definitely Maybe (1994). The following year the band 
			recorded (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (1995) with drummer Alan White, in the midst of a chart rivalry with Britpop peers Blur. Along with Suede, Pulp, Blur and others, 
			Oasis came to be regarded as one of the major bands of the Britpop movement. In many respects, they eclipsed their peers in terms of commercial success and their influence 
			on British culture. (What's the Story) Morning Glory? became one of the best-selling albums of all time, selling 22 million copies worldwide and the Gallagher brothers were 
			featured regularly in tabloid newspapers for their sibling disputes and wild lifestyles. In 1996, Oasis performed two nights at Knebworth for an audience of 125,000 each 
			night, which were at the time the largest outdoor concerts in UK history. 2.5 million people applied for tickets, which remains the highest demand for a show in British 
			history. In 1997, Oasis released their third album, Be Here Now (1997); although it was the fastest-selling album in UK chart history, and went on to sell 8 million copies, 
			its popularity tapered off quickly.</p>

			<p>McGuigan and Arthurs left Oasis in 1999 as the band released Standing on the Shoulder of Giants (2000). They were replaced by former Heavy Stereo guitarist/frontman Gem 
			Archer and former Ride guitarist/frontman Andy Bell. Their fifth studio album Heathen Chemistry was released in 2002. In 2004, White left, leaving them as a four-piece, with 
			the addition of the Who drummer Zak Starkey as an unofficial recording and touring fifth member. They found renewed success and popularity with Don't Believe the Truth (2005).[1] 
			Following the recording of the band's seventh album Dig Out Your Soul in May 2008, Starkey, who had been made an official member during the recording sessions, departed. Chris 
			Sharrock was recruited as a touring member, and Oasis did their last tour as a collective band. During the tour the Gallagher brothers' deteriorating relationship led to Noel 
			Gallagher announcing his departure in August 2009, after a backstage altercation with Liam.[2][3][4] The band, led by Liam, continue under the name Beady Eye until their breakup 
			in 2014.[5] Noel formed a solo project, Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds.</p>

			<p>Oasis have had eight UK number-one singles and eight UK number-one albums. They have won seventeen NME Awards, nine Q Awards, four MTV Europe Music Awards and six British 
			Awards, including one in 2007 for Outstanding Contribution to Music and one for the Best Album of the Last 30 Years–for (What's the Story) Morning Glory?–as voted by BBC 
			Radio 2 listeners; (What's the Story) Morning Glory? is also the fifth best-selling album in UK chart history, and was the UK's biggest-selling album of the 1990s. They have 
			been nominated for three Grammy Awards. As of 2009, Oasis have sold over 70 million records worldwide.[6] The band were listed in the Guinness World Records book in 2010 for 
			"Longest Top 10 UK Chart Run by a Group" after an unprecedented run of 22 top 10 hits in the UK.[7] The band also holds the Guinness World Record for the most successful act 
			in the UK between the years 1995 and 2005, spending 765 weeks in the top 75 singles and albums charts.[8][9]</p>
